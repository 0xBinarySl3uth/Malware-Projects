# Benefits DLL Loader

- The payload loader to be created will take the form of a DLL file for several reasons:

1. DLLs can be discreetly loaded and executed by legitimate application while they are running, rendering them less conspicuous compared to standalone EXE files.
2. They can be effectively used in DDL search order exploits, DLL sideloading.

- Loader Capabilities

1. Indirect-syscalls using an improved Hellshall Implementation
2. DLL Unhooking via KnownDLLs 
3. Payload injection by chunking
4. Using custom AES encryption library
5. Executing payload via Thread POOLs
6. Obfuscate IAT using API Hashing and API camouflage
7. CRT library independent

# Improving HellsHall

- HellsHall serves the purpose of evading user-land hooking through the utilization of indirect syscalls. It does this by redirecting the execution to a syscall instruction located within `ntdll.dll`, rather than executing it directly from the implementation memory.
- We will modify HellsHall, we will unhook routine that will be using RW memory permission, instead of using RWX permission. We need to find a syscal outside of the address space of `ntdll.dll`.

## Using Win32.dll

The `Win32u.dll` library there are syscalls function that have syscall instructions that our loader can se when executing HellsHall.
